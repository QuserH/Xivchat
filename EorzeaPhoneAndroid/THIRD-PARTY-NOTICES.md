# Third-Party Notices

This project bundles or depends on third-party software. Their licenses and
required notices are reproduced below. This file is shipped inside every
release archive alongside the components it covers.

## Inter font family

The fonts under `src/Aetherphone/Fonts/` (Inter Regular, Medium, SemiBold,
Bold) are redistributed unmodified.

- Copyright (c) 2016 The Inter Project Authors (https://github.com/rsms/inter)
- License: SIL Open Font License 1.1
- Full license text: `src/Aetherphone/Fonts/Inter-OFL.txt`, shipped next to
  the fonts in every release archive.

## Tabler Icons

The application icons under `src/Aetherphone/Icons/` are derived from
[Tabler Icons](https://tabler.io/icons) (recolored and rasterized to PNG).

  the MIT section below.

## Twemoji

The color emoji images under `src/Aetherphone/Emoji/` (3,512 PNGs, one per
emoji sequence) are the 72x72 assets of
[Twemoji](https://github.com/jdecked/twemoji) 15.1.0, redistributed
unmodified.

  (CC-BY 4.0), https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/

The emoji metadata in `src/Aetherphone/Emoji/catalog.json` (labels, groups,
search tags, shortcodes and skin-tone variants) is built from
[emojibase-data](https://github.com/milesj/emojibase) by Miles Johnson,
MIT License; full text reproduced in the MIT section below.

## mpv

libmpv provides video decoding and playback for the AetherStream app. No mpv
binary is redistributed with this plugin:
`src/Aetherphone/Core/Video/MediaDependencies.cs` downloads an LGPL build
(`mpv-dev-lgpl-x86_64-*`, from the
[zhongfly/mpv-winbuild](https://github.com/zhongfly/mpv-winbuild) releases)
into the plugin's own Dalamud config directory on first use, and keeps it
updated from there.

- License: GNU Lesser General Public License v2.1 or later (LGPL build
  configuration); full text: https://www.gnu.org/licenses/old-licenses/lgpl-2.1.html

## yt-dlp

yt-dlp is used by mpv's own `ytdl_hook` to resolve video URLs from sites other
than YouTube (YouTube itself is resolved separately via YoutubeExplode, already
a dependency). As with mpv above, no yt-dlp binary is redistributed: it is
downloaded from the project's own GitHub releases into the plugin's Dalamud
config directory on first use.

## AlphaChannel (Voudi)

AetherStream's video/screen engine under `src/Aetherphone/Core/Video/`
(mpv-backed playback and the world-anchored ScreenPainter D3D11 quad
renderer) is ported from
[AlphaChannel](https://github.com/Voudi/AlphaChannel) by Voudi, used with the
author's permission. Two smaller pieces ported from the same source live
outside that directory: the screen placement controls and presets in
`src/Aetherphone/Apps/AetherStream/AetherStreamApp.Casting.cs` (from
AlphaChannel's `ControlWindow.DrawScreenPositionSettings`) and the saved
screen preset shape in `src/Aetherphone/Configuration.cs` (from its
`Configuration`, with yaw added). Both are modified from the originals.

## Karashiiro.HtmlAgilityPack.CssSelectors.NetCoreFork

`Karashiiro.HtmlAgilityPack.CssSelectors.NetCoreFork.dll` (version 0.0.2, by
karashiiro and Thibaut Renoncourt) is a fork of HtmlAgilityPack.CssSelectors
pulled in by NetStone. The package declares no license metadata; the upstream
HtmlAgilityPack.CssSelectors project is published under the MIT License
(https://github.com/trenoncourt/HtmlAgilityPack.CssSelectors).

## Calendar event data

The Calendar app shows in-game event dates served through the Aetherphone
backend, which caches a community-maintained public events database. The data
is fetched server-side; no third-party credentials ship with the plugin.
